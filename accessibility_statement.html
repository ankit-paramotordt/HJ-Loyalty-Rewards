                2.3. Our digital properties are developed, maintained, and updated in reference to internationally recognized accessibility standards, specifically the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA, as published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
                2.4. We recognize that accessibility is a continuous journey requiring regular review, adaptation, and improvement as standards, technologies, and user needs evolve.

                3.1. To achieve and maintain accessibility, HJ Reward integrates inclusive design principles throughout the lifecycle of our digital platforms.<br>
                3.2. Our accessibility measures include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
                3.2.1. Conducting both automated and manual accessibility testing to proactively identify and remedy barriers encountered by users with disabilities.<br>
                3.2.2. Providing text alternatives (alt text) for all non-text content to ensure that users employing assistive technologies can access equivalent information.<br>
                3.2.3. Ensuring that all features and functions of the Site are operable via keyboard navigation, without requiring mouse input.<br>
                3.2.4. Implementing sufficient colour contrast, clear font readability, and scalable text options to enhance visibility and legibility across devices and user preferences.<br>
                3.2.5. Training team members, including developers and content creators, as well as third-party service providers, to integrate accessibility best practices into all aspects of design, development, and maintenance.<br>
                3.2.6. Regularly reviewing the Site to monitor for accessibility compliance and make necessary updates.<br>
                3.2.7. Utilizing accessible forms, error identification, and feedback mechanisms to support user engagement and interaction.<br>
                3.2.8. Integrating ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where appropriate to improve compatibility with assistive technologies.<br>
                3.3. While we strive to adhere to accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the Site. We are committed to ongoing evaluation and to addressing any accessibility issues identified.
