                <p>HJ Reward is committed to ensuring the security, integrity, and protection of Member accounts and Programme data. We employ a variety of technical, administrative, and operational measures to detect and prevent fraudulent activities and unauthorized access to the Programme. These measures include but are not limited to encryption, multi-factor authentication, system monitoring, and regular security audits.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">HJ Reward utilizes advanced fraud detection technologies to identify and mitigate fraudulent or suspicious activities, including but not limited to point manipulation, account cloning, unauthorized account access, and misuse of Programme benefits. We employ the following fraud prevention measures to safeguard the Programme:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Manual Transaction Review:</strong> We conduct manual reviews of transactions where suspicious activity is detected to ensure the legitimacy of the transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Fraud Detection System:</strong> An automated system continuously monitors Member activity and transactions for any unusual behavior or patterns indicative of fraud or misuse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partner Reporting Checks:</strong> We work closely with our Partners to conduct reporting checks and ensure compliance with the Programme’s terms, as well as to detect and prevent any fraudulent activities that may arise through Partner interactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">Members are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account credentials, including their username, password, and any other security information related to their account. Members must take all reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access to their account. HJ Reward will not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions or damages resulting from a Member's failure to maintain account security.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">In the event that a Member suspects unauthorized activity or any security breach involving their account, they must immediately report the issue to HJ Reward through the designated support channels. Upon receipt of such a report, HJ Reward will promptly investigate the matter and take appropriate steps to secure the account and prevent further unauthorized access.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">HJ Reward implements a range of security measures to protect the personal data and financial information of Members. This includes the use of encryption, secure servers, firewalls, and anti-virus protections. While we strive to protect your data and account, Members must understand that no security system is impenetrable. By using the Programme, Members acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with online transactions and activities.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">HJ Reward reserves the right to monitor accounts for unusual activity or behavior that may indicate misuse or fraud. In such cases, we may request additional information or verification from the Member to confirm the legitimacy of the transactions. Failure to comply with such requests may result in account suspension or termination.</p>
