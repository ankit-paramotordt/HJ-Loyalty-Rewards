      <article class="prose max-w-none card p-6 leading-7">
        <h2 class="serif text-2xl mb-3">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>IBL Ltd (BRN: C07001778) (“IBL”, “we”, “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy and to ensure that your personal data is collected and processed lawfully. As a result, we would like to inform you regarding the way we would use and process your personal data when you become a member of IBL Loyalty program (“<strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong>”, “the Programme”) as defined in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you read this Privacy Notice (hereafter the “Notice”) so that you understand our approach towards the use of your personal data. Should your personal data be processed other than for the purposes of <strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong>, you will be required to give your consent to such processing.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree with these terms, you choose not to provide your personal data and this will impact on our ability to enroll you with <strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong>. This Notice forms part of our Terms and Conditions and such shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the relevant laws.</p>
        <p>This Notice has been designed in compliance with the provisions of the Mauritius Data Protection Act 2017 (hereafter the “MDPA”).</p>

        <h2 class="serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-3">2. Our Services</h2>
        <p>IBL provides <strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong> (as defined in the Terms &amp; Conditions) through its website <a class="underline text-astronaut" href="https://www.wiivrewards.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.wiivrewards.com</a> (“Website”) and the software application installed on your smartphone (“App”).</p>
        <p>When you use the 'Quick Enroll' method to register to <strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong>, which is the first step in the registration process, your NIC and mobile number, along with purchase details and points earned during this initial transaction, are stored in the programme’s database for 72 hours. If the member completes the full enrollment process to become a confirmed member, their personal data and points are stored until they choose to delete their account. However, if the member does not complete the full enrollment within the specified 72-hour period, their collected personal data, purchase details, and earned points are permanently deleted from our system and database.</p>
        <p>Therefore, once you’re registered and use the membership card, you will earn points or discounts off products and services at selected Partners. By using the card, you also give us the opportunity to learn more about your purchase habits and offer you personalised information and/or promotions. When you redeem points worth 200 points or more, you authorize us to send you a one-time-password (OTP) as a security measure. This OTP must then be provided to the cashier to complete the transaction.</p>
        <p>By accepting the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Notice of <strong>HJ Loyalty &amp; Rewards</strong>, you also consent to the processing of your personal data as described in this section.</p>

        <h2 class="serif text-2xl mt-8 mb-3">3. Collection of Personal data</h2>
        <p>We collect and process your personal data mainly upon registration to provide you with access to our Services, to support our contractual relationship with you and while using your membership card as part of the Programme. In certain instances, we may process your personal data for certain other purposes as detailed below and for this, your consent shall be sought beforehand.</p>
        <p>We collect personal information of members of the Programme while they use their card at the Partners’ outlets, via an external registration loyalty cloud platform &amp; administration system.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of personal data:</strong></p>
